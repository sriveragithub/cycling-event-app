# Cycling Event App

What is the project? - This cycling event app is a project to build a one-stop website for event organizers and racers to create, manage, and sign-up for cycling events around the world. This project is currently being built with PostgreSQL, Express JS, React and Node (PERN stack). It will allow organizers to create events and races, manage their entrants and view reports. It will also allow racers to sign up for events and manage their entrant information.

What is the MVP? - The minimum viable product for this app is to have a CRUD app talking to a database that allows an organizer to create events and allow racers to sign-up for those events.

What are the nice to haves? -  The nice to haves for this project would be styling for the website as a whole, persistent data, web-hosting on AWS, and login functionality for racers and organizers.

When will the project be complete? - The project will be complete once all the MVP features have been implemented and basic styling has been applied.
